# MonsterDraft

Monster draft is a mobile deck drafting card game with a battlefield instead of victory points. You play cards to get coins and buy new cards. The cards you gain let you summon monsters to the field to defend your castle and attack the enemy dungeon. The cards available to buy are different every round to add variation to the game. The deck you start with can be modified using prestige points earned by winning rounds. Between rounds you get to pick a card to add to your deck for the rest of the run.
