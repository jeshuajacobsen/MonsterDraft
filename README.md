Monster draft is a mobile deck drafting card game with a battlefield instead of victory points. You play cards to get coins and buy new cards. 
The cards you gain let you summon monsters to the field to defend your castle and attack the enemy dungeon. The cards available to buy are different every round to add variation to the game. 
The deck you start with can be modified using prestige points earned by winning rounds. Between rounds you get to pick a card to add to your deck for the rest of the run.

The game is still in developmentso it doesn't have clear messaging about what is happening and there are some glitches but the game is playable in its current state. It needs more fleshing out and UI imporovements but I wanted to get the major features in first before working out the details.

The main page has the options to Edit Deck, Start Run, or Improve Cards. Improve cards doesn't do anything yet.

Edit Deck lets you buy cards and change which cards you start a run with.

When you start a run there are two pages the Town and the Dungeon with the game onfo on the bottom left and your hand on the bottom right. You can see details about cards or monsters by pressing the ? buttons.

You can play the cards in your hand by dragging them onto the town or dungeon panel. You can use one action per turn but can get more from playing cards. Cards can produce Coins and Mana. Coins are used in the town to buy cards to add to your deck. Buying cards puts them into your discard pile and when your deck runs out your discard pile is shuffled in so you start to see the cards that you've bought.

The dungeon is where you can deploy monsters to the field or use cards on the existing monsters. The objective of the game is to bring the enemy dungeon's health to 0 without your own base reaching 0. Mana is used for summoning monsters as well as using your monster's attacks. Clicking on a monster opens an option menu that shows the available attacks and the directions the attack can be used.

A run has 5 rounds and in between rounds you get to pick a card you bought this round to bring with you to the next round.
